# Phase 08 Audit — Code Quality, Security & Maintainability

## Output Mode

`problems-only: true` — **only problems, bugs, and deviations are documented.**

- **Do NOT** write sections that say "X is correct" or "no issues found in Y".
- **Do NOT** include checklist rows where the check passes — omit them entirely.
- If a dimension has zero findings after investigation, **omit the dimension entirely**.
- Every finding must be actionable: it describes a real problem, its evidence (code/logs/output), and its impact.

---

## Discovery Stage

Before performing audit checks, discover the codebase quality landscape:

1. **Codebase Structure** — Map all source files, their sizes, and responsibilities. Identify any files that are unusually large (potential god modules).
2. **Import Graph** — Map all imports. Identify circular imports, unused imports, and cross-layer imports.
3. **Quality Patterns** — Search for `print()` statements, bare `except:`, `TODO`/`FIXME` comments, and other code smells.
4. **Security Surface** — Identify all places where external input is processed (config values, API responses, file paths).

---

## Mandatory Runtime Verification

**Before evaluating any checklist item, you MUST complete these steps. Use the commands provided in the project's commands file. Skip only if a step is impossible — document why.**

### Step R1 — Linter and Type Checker

Run the project's configured linter and type checker commands.

- Record all errors and warnings. Each is evidence.

### Step R2 — Run Test Suite

Run the complete test suite.

- Record pass/fail counts and failure output.

### Step R3 — Dead Code Search

Search for unreachable or unused code:

- Functions/methods defined but never called outside tests.
- Imported modules that are never used.
- Variables assigned but never read.
- Conditional branches that are always true/false.

Record each instance with file:line.

### Step R4 — Security Search

Search the codebase for:

- Hardcoded secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords).
- `print()` statements (forbidden by project rules).
- Bare `except:` clauses.
- `logger` calls that might log sensitive data (credentials, tokens).

## Audit Scope

All source code files. Code quality, type safety, security, maintainability, project convention compliance.

---

## Audit Dimensions

### 1. Code Quality

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| No `print()` statements | All output uses `logger`. `print()` is forbidden in production code. |
| No bare `except:` | All exceptions are caught with specific types. |
| Type hints everywhere | All public functions and methods have type hints on parameters and return values. |
| No `any` types | Type annotations are specific, not `Any`. |
| Small functions | Functions are focused and short. No function exceeds ~50 lines without clear justification. |
| Clear naming | Variable, function, and class names are descriptive and consistent. |
| English only | All comments, docstrings, logs, and error messages are in English. |

**Evidence required:** Linter output. Manual code review. Search for `print(`, `except:`, and missing type hints.

### 2. Security

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| No hardcoded secrets | No API keys, tokens, passwords, or credentials in source code. |
| Credentials not logged | Sensitive values (api_hash, bot token, phone number) are never logged. |
| Path traversal prevention | File paths from config/user input are validated before use. |
| Error messages don't leak internals | Error messages to users don't include stack traces, file paths, or internal details. |
| Config file permissions | Credentials files (credentials.json, token.json) are stored in the user's private config directory. |

**Evidence required:** Search for hardcoded secrets. Read error handling code. Check logger calls near sensitive data.

### 3. Maintainability

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| No dead code | Every function and class is used. No orphaned modules. |
| No overengineering | Abstractions match the project's complexity. No unnecessary design patterns. |
| Consistent conventions | Naming, formatting, and architectural patterns are consistent across the codebase. |
| Docstrings on public APIs | All public classes and functions have docstrings. |
| Comments for non-trivial logic | Complex logic is explained with comments. Obvious code is not over-commented. |

**Evidence required:** Dead code search results. Code review for overengineering. Check docstring coverage.

### 4. Project Convention Compliance

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Pydantic for all data models | Configuration and data structures use Pydantic models, not raw dicts. |
| `StrEnum` for fixed values | Fixed-value fields use `StrEnum`, not plain strings. |
| `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` | Every module uses the standard logger pattern. |
| Path resolution via `PathResolver`/`APP_PATHS` | No hardcoded paths. All paths use the project's path resolution utilities. |
| Layer separation | CLI → Service → Reader. No cross-layer imports. |

**Evidence required:** Search for raw dict usage, plain string constants, `print()`, hardcoded paths, and cross-layer imports.

### 5. Dependency Hygiene

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| No unused imports | Every import is used. |
| No circular imports | The import graph is acyclic. |
| Dependencies are justified | Every dependency in `pyproject.toml` is actually used in the code. |
| No cross-package leakage | The project does not import from unrelated packages. |

**Evidence required:** Linter output for unused imports. Import graph analysis. Compare `pyproject.toml` dependencies against actual imports.

## Report Output

Write findings to: `/.ai/audit/08-quality/findings.md` using template `/.ai/audit/templates/audit-findings.md`.

use prefix `QLT-` for finding IDs.

**`problems-only: true` rules:**
- The report contains **only findings** — real problems discovered during investigation.
- Do NOT include sections, dimensions, or checklist rows where everything is correct.
- If after completing all Runtime Verification steps and all Audit Dimensions, no problems were found, write a single line: `No problems found in this phase.`
- Every finding MUST include:
  1. **Runtime evidence** — linter output, grep results, file:line of problematic code.
  2. **Not just:** "violates invariant X" — show the exact code and the exact maintenance/security consequence.
