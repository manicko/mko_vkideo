# Phase 07 Audit — Test Quality

## Purpose

This phase audits the **test suite**: coverage of critical paths, test correctness,
isolation, and the presence of anti-patterns (tautologies, over-mocking, order
dependence). The goal is to find places where the suite gives a false sense of safety.

This file is written as a **reusable handbook** for the test-quality phase of any audit.
It deliberately avoids naming specific files, function names, or paths — instead it
describes *what to discover and verify*. Apply it to whatever test framework and
structure the current system actually uses.

## Output Mode

`problems-only: true` — **only problems, bugs, and deviations are documented.**

- **Do NOT** write sections that say "X is correct" or "no issues found in Y".
- **Do NOT** include checklist rows where the check passes — omit them entirely.
- If a dimension has zero findings after investigation, **omit the dimension entirely**.
- Every finding must be actionable: it describes a real problem, its evidence (code/logs/output), and its impact.

## Discovery Stage

Before performing audit checks, discover the testing architecture:

1. **Test Framework Discovery** — Identify the test runner, map test organization (unit per module), discover fixture patterns, find the mocking strategy.
2. **Coverage Discovery** — Map which architectural blocks have tests: entry point, config/models, services/processing units, integrations, data flow.
3. **Test Patterns Discovery** — Identify common anti-patterns, map mocking strategies, discover assertion patterns, find async/sync test handling.
4. **Quality Discovery** — Identify tautological tests, map coverage gaps in critical paths, discover test brittleness indicators.

## Mandatory Runtime Verification

**Before evaluating any checklist item, you MUST complete these steps. Use the commands provided in the project's commands file. Skip only if a step is impossible — document why.**

### Step R1 — Run the Full Test Suite

Run the project's test suite and capture the complete output.

- Record pass/fail/skip counts.
- Record every failure with its full traceback.
- Record total execution time — excessively slow tests are a finding.
- If the test suite cannot run at all (import errors, config errors), that is CRITICAL.

### Step R2 — Analyze Test Failures

For each failing test from Step R1:

- Read the test code and the code it tests.
- Determine: is the test wrong, or is the production code wrong?
- If the production code is wrong, that is a CRITICAL finding (the bug exists in production).
- If the test is wrong (outdated, incorrect assertion), that is a finding (false sense of security).

### Step R3 — Detect Tautological and No-Op Tests

Search for tests that cannot fail or test nothing:

- Tests with no assertions (only `pass` or no body).
- Tests that assert a literal (`assert True`, `assert 1 == 1`).
- Tests that only call a function without checking the result.
- Tests where the mock is asserted to have been called, but the mock IS the implementation (testing the mock, not the logic).

Each instance is a finding with file:line.

### Step R4 — Verify Test Isolation

Run the test suite multiple times in sequence (or shuffle test order if the runner supports it).

- If tests pass individually but fail in suite: shared state between tests. Finding.
- If test results are non-deterministic: race condition or time-dependent test. Finding.
- Read test fixtures: verify cleanup happens even on test failure (teardown/fixture finalizers).

### Step R5 — Coverage Gap Analysis

Identify critical paths with low or zero coverage:

- For each critical architectural block, check if tests exist.
- For each critical path without tests, create a finding.
- If no coverage tool is configured, note it (but it is not a finding for a small CLI tool — coverage is advisory).

## Audit Scope

All test files, test fixtures, mocking strategies, test coverage, and test isolation.

## Audit Dimensions

> For each dimension, adapt the concrete checks to the system's actual architectural
> blocks. A dimension is omitted from the report if no problem is found in it.

### 1. Critical Path Coverage

| Component | Must Have Tests For |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Entry point / commands | Each command/endpoint. Error paths tested. |
| Config loading | Valid config, invalid config, missing config, path resolution. |
| Settings models | Model validation, field constraints, custom validators, unknown-key handling. |
| Processing units | Filter/extraction logic, limits, empty data. |
| Cache units | Resize/cache-hit/cache-miss, error handling, cleanup. |
| Output/posting units | Sending, retry logic, rate-limit/flood control. |
| Integrations | Auth/connection flow, API error handling, data format, path resolution. |
| Init / scaffold service | Template copying, force flag, path creation. |
| Error handling | Custom exceptions raised correctly. |

**For each component without tests, create a finding.**

### 2. Test Anti-Patterns

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| No tautological tests | Every test can actually fail. |
| Assertions verify outcomes | Tests check return values and side effects, not just mock call counts. |
| Mocks at boundaries only | External systems are mocked. Internal logic is tested directly. |
| No shared mutable state | Tests are independent and can run in any order. |
| Tests don't depend on execution order | Any test can run in isolation. |
| No over-mocking | Tests do not mock the function they are testing. |

**Evidence required:** Read test files. For each anti-pattern found, provide file:line.

### 3. Mock Correctness

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Mocks match real API | Mock return values match the real external response format. |
| Error paths are mocked | Tests cover external error scenarios (not just happy paths) by mocking error responses. |
| Async mocks are correct | If the service uses async, mocks use the async mock equivalent. |

**Evidence required:** Read mock setups in test files. Compare mock return values against real response formats.

### 4. Test Quality Indicators

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Tests are readable | Test names describe the scenario. Setup is minimal. Assertions are clear. |
| Tests are fast | Unit tests complete quickly. No real network calls in unit tests. |
| Tests are deterministic | Same input always produces the same result. No time-dependent tests without freezing. |

**Evidence required:** Read test files. Run the test suite and check execution time.

## Report Output

Write findings to: `/.ai/audit/07-tests/findings.md` using template `/.ai/audit/templates/audit-findings.md`.

Use prefix `TST-` for finding IDs.

**`problems-only: true` rules:**
- The report contains **only findings** — real problems discovered during investigation.
- Do NOT include sections, dimensions, or checklist rows where everything is correct.
- If after completing all Runtime Verification steps and all Audit Dimensions, no problems were found, write a single line: `No problems found in this phase.`
- Every finding MUST include:
  1. **Runtime evidence** — test output, failure tracebacks, coverage gaps, file:line of problematic tests.
  2. **Not just:** "test coverage is low" — show exactly which critical path has no tests and what bug could go undetected.
